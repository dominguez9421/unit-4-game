# unit-4-game
the user will have the choice among four images to choose from and will give out a random number the user must match the given number if the player wins or loses the game will restart and the numbers will reset among the images. 

to start with the html we must create about 5 contianers. Befor that I created a header for tittle of the game, then I created a second container which will have the instructions for the user. 

Then the next containers are small but these are the most important because this will hold our variables that are important to the game such as: the target score, the user's score, and the crystal selection that the user clicks on. 

the last two containers will be the score keepers I want to be able to let the user know how many times the user has won or lost during their play time. 

for my theme, I decided to go with a Zelda theme since it is a game that has ruppies but will continue with the styling later on. 

I decided to use the template from bootsrtap to make it responsive to movement. 

I created the header called crystal games. Then the second container will have the instructions above for the user to understand the procress of this game. 

Two small panels are created that will display the target score and the user's score. I must specifically give ID's as these are important to keep track of the user score. 

then a panel for the crystals is necesary for each of the crystals
